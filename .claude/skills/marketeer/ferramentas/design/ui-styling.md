*Quando usar:* Create beautiful, accessible user interfaces with shadcn/ui components (built on Radix UI + Tailwind), Tailwind CSS utility-first styling, and canvas-based visual designs. Use when building user interfaces, implementing design systems, creating responsive layouts, adding accessible components (dialogs, dropdowns, forms, tables), customizing themes and colors, implementing dark mode, generating visual designs and posters, or establishing consistent styling patterns across applications.


# UI Styling Skill

Comprehensive skill for creating beautiful, accessible user interfaces combining shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS utility styling, and canvas-based visual design systems.

## Reference

- shadcn/ui: https://ui.shadcn.com/llms.txt

## Script Paths

Script paths in this skill and its `references/` are relative to the directory that contains this SKILL.md, not to the project: `scripts/<file>` is this skill's own `scripts/` folder, and `../<skill>/scripts/<file>` is a sibling sub-skill installed alongside it. Build the full path from that directory (Claude Code reports it as the skill's base directory when the skill loads) and keep the working directory at the project root — the scripts read and write project files such as `docs/brand-guidelines.md`, `assets/design-tokens.json` or `src/` relative to it.

## Quick Start

### Component + Styling Setup

**Install shadcn/ui with Tailwind:**
```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

CLI prompts for framework, TypeScript, paths, and theme preferences. This configures both shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS.

**Add components:**
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button card dialog form
```

**Use components with utility styling:**
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"

export function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-6 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
      <Card className="hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle className="text-2xl font-bold">Analytics</CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent className="space-y-4">
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">View your metrics</p>
          <Button variant="default" className="w-full">
            View Details
          </Button>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Alternative: Tailwind-Only Setup

**Vite projects:**
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

```javascript
// vite.config.ts
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
export default { plugins: [tailwindcss()] }
```

```css
/* src/index.css */
@import "tailwindcss";
```

## Tailwind Utilities

**Core utility classes for layout, spacing, typography, colors, borders, and shadows.**

See: `references/tailwind-utilities.md`

Covers:
- Layout utilities (Flexbox, Grid, positioning)
- Spacing system (padding, margin, gap)
- Typography (font sizes, weights, alignment, line height)
- Colors and backgrounds
- Borders and shadows
- Arbitrary values for custom styling

## Responsive Design

**Mobile-first breakpoints, responsive utilities, and adaptive layouts.**

See: `references/tailwind-responsive.md`

Covers:
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint system (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- Responsive utility patterns
- Container queries
- Max-width queries
- Custom breakpoints

## Tailwind Customization

**Config file structure, custom utilities, plugins, and theme extensions.**

See: `references/tailwind-customization.md`

Covers:
- @theme directive for custom tokens
- Custom colors and fonts
- Spacing and breakpoint extensions
- Custom utility creation
- Custom variants
- Layer organization (@layer base, components, utilities)
- Apply directive for component extraction

## Visual Design System

**Canvas-based design philosophy, visual communication principles, and sophisticated compositions.**

See: `references/canvas-design-system.md`

Covers:
- Design philosophy approach
- Visual communication over text
- Systematic patterns and composition
- Color, form, and spatial design
- Minimal text integration
- Museum-quality execution
- Multi-page design systems

## Utility Scripts

**Python automation for component installation and configuration generation.**

### shadcn_add.py
Add shadcn/ui components with dependency handling:
```bash
python scripts/shadcn_add.py button card dialog
```

### tailwind_config_gen.py
Generate tailwind.config.js with custom theme:
```bash
python scripts/tailwind_config_gen.py --colors brand:blue --fonts display:Inter
```

The generator refuses to create or replace a config when any sibling
`tailwind.config.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, or `.ts` file already exists. Review the
reported config first, then pass `--force` only when the competing output is
intentional:
```bash
python scripts/tailwind_config_gen.py --colors brand:blue --force
```

## Best Practices

1. **Component Composition**: Build complex UIs from simple, composable primitives
2. **Utility-First Styling**: Use Tailwind classes directly; extract components only for true repetition
3. **Mobile-First Responsive**: Start with mobile styles, layer responsive variants
4. **Accessibility-First**: Leverage Radix UI primitives, add focus states, use semantic HTML
5. **Design Tokens**: Use consistent spacing scale, color palettes, typography system
6. **Dark Mode Consistency**: Apply dark variants to all themed elements
7. **Performance**: Leverage automatic CSS purging, avoid dynamic class names
8. **TypeScript**: Use full type safety for better DX
9. **Visual Hierarchy**: Let composition guide attention, use spacing and color intentionally
10. **Expert Craftsmanship**: Every detail matters - treat UI as a craft

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8)
})

export function LoginForm() {
  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
    defaultValues: { email: "", password: "" }
  })

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(console.log)} className="space-y-6">
        <FormField control={form.control} name="email" render={({ field }) => (
          <FormItem>
            <FormLabel>Email</FormLabel>
            <FormControl>
              <Input type="email" {...field} />
            </FormControl>
            <FormMessage />
          </FormItem>
        )} />
        <Button type="submit" className="w-full">Sign In</Button>
      </form>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

**Responsive layout with dark mode:**
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-white dark:bg-gray-900">
  <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      <Card className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
        <CardContent className="p-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
            Content
          </h3>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

# Canvas Design System

Visual design philosophy, systematic composition, and sophisticated visual communication.

## Design Philosophy Approach

Canvas design operates through two-phase process:

### Phase 1: Design Philosophy Creation

Create visual philosophy - aesthetic movement expressed through form, space, color, composition. Not layouts or templates, but pure visual philosophy.

**What is created:** Design manifesto emphasizing:
- Visual expression over text
- Spatial communication
- Artistic interpretation
- Minimal words as visual accent

**Philosophy structure (4-6 paragraphs):**
- Space and form principles
- Color and material approach
- Scale and rhythm guidance
- Composition and balance rules
- Visual hierarchy system

### Phase 2: Visual Expression

Express philosophy through canvas artifacts:
- 90% visual design
- 10% essential text
- Museum-quality execution
- Systematic patterns
- Sophisticated composition

## Core Principles

### 1. Visual Communication First

Information lives in design, not paragraphs. Express ideas through:
- Color zones and fields
- Geometric precision
- Spatial relationships
- Visual weight and tension
- Form and structure

### 2. Minimal Text Integration

Text as rare, powerful gesture:
- Never paragraphs
- Only essential words
- Integrated into visual architecture
- Small labels, huge impact
- Typography as visual element

### 3. Expert Craftsmanship

Work must appear:
- Meticulously crafted
- Labored over with care
- Product of countless hours
- From absolute top of field
- Master-level execution

### 4. Systematic Patterns

Use scientific visual language:
- Repeating patterns
- Perfect shapes
- Dense accumulation of marks
- Layered elements
- Patient repetition rewards sustained viewing

## Design Movement Examples

### Concrete Poetry
**Philosophy:** Communication through monumental form and bold geometry.

**Expression:**
- Massive color blocks
- Sculptural typography (huge words, tiny labels)
- Brutalist spatial divisions
- Polish poster energy meets Le Corbusier
- Ideas through visual weight and spatial tension
- Text as rare, powerful gesture

### Chromatic Language
**Philosophy:** Color as primary information system.

**Expression:**
- Geometric precision
- Color zones create meaning
- Typography minimal - small sans-serif labels
- Josef Albers' interaction meets data visualization
- Information encoded spatially and chromatically
- Words only anchor what color shows

### Analog Meditation
**Philosophy:** Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room.

**Expression:**
- Paper grain, ink bleeds
- Vast negative space
- Photography and illustration dominate
- Typography whispered (small, restrained)
- Japanese photobook aesthetic
- Images breathe across pages
- Text appears sparingly - short phrases only

### Organic Systems
**Philosophy:** Natural clustering and modular growth patterns.

**Expression:**
- Rounded forms
- Organic arrangements
- Color from nature through architecture
- Information through visual diagrams
- Spatial relationships and iconography
- Text only for key labels floating in space
- Composition tells story through spatial orchestration

### Geometric Silence
**Philosophy:** Pure order and restraint.

**Expression:**
- Grid-based precision
- Bold photography or stark graphics
- Dramatic negative space
- Typography precise but minimal
- Small essential text, large quiet zones
- Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty
- Structure communicates, not words
- Every alignment from countless refinements

## Implementation Guidelines

### Subtle Reference Integration

Embed conceptual DNA without announcing:
- Niche reference woven invisibly
- Those who know feel it intuitively
- Others experience masterful abstract composition
- Like jazz musician quoting another song
- Sophisticated, never literal
- Reference enhances depth quietly

### Color Approach

**Intentional palette:**
- Limited colors (2-5)
- Cohesive system
- Purposeful relationships
- oklch color space for precision
- Each shade carries meaning

**Example palette:**
```
--color-primary: oklch(0.55 0.22 264)
--color-accent: oklch(0.75 0.18 45)
--color-neutral: oklch(0.90 0.02 264)
--color-dark: oklch(0.25 0.15 264)
```

### Typography System

**Thin fonts preferred:**
- Light weights (200-300)
- Clean sans-serifs
- Geometric precision
- Small sizes for labels
- Large sizes for impact moments

**Font integration:**
- Fonts: download from Google Fonts (the bundled canvas-fonts folder was removed to fit the upload limit)
- Download needed fonts
- Bring typography onto canvas
- Part of art, not typeset digitally

### Composition Rules

**Systematic approach:**
- Repeating patterns establish rhythm
- Perfect geometric shapes
- Clinical typography
- Reference markers suggest imaginary discipline
- Dense accumulation builds meaning
- Layered patterns reward attention

**Spacing discipline:**
- Nothing falls off page
- Nothing overlaps
- Every element within canvas boundaries
- Proper margins non-negotiable
- Breathing room and clear separation
- Professional execution mandatory

### Canvas Boundaries

**Technical specs:**
- Single page default (multi-page when requested)
- PDF or PNG output
- High resolution
- Clean margins
- Contained composition
- Flawless formatting

## Multi-Page Design Systems

When creating multiple pages:

### Approach
- Treat first page as single page in coffee table book
- Create more pages along same philosophy
- Distinctly different but cohesive
- Pages tell story tastefully
- Full creative freedom

### Consistency Elements
- Shared color palette
- Consistent typography system
- Related compositional approach
- Visual language continuity
- Philosophical thread throughout

### Variation Strategy
- Unique twist per page
- Different focal points
- Varied spatial arrangements
- Complementary patterns
- Progressive visual narrative

## Execution Checklist

Before finalizing:

- [ ] Philosophy guides every decision
- [ ] 90% visual, 10% text maximum
- [ ] Text minimal and integrated
- [ ] Nothing overlaps or falls off page
- [ ] Margins and spacing pristine
- [ ] Composition cohesive with art
- [ ] Appears meticulously crafted
- [ ] Master-level execution evident
- [ ] Sophisticated, never amateur
- [ ] Could be displayed in museum
- [ ] Proves undeniable expertise
- [ ] Formatting flawless
- [ ] Every detail perfect

## Quality Standards

### What to Avoid
- Cartoony aesthetics
- Amateur execution

# shadcn/ui Accessibility Patterns

ARIA patterns, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and accessible component usage.

## Foundation: Radix UI Primitives

shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives - unstyled, accessible components following WAI-ARIA design patterns.

Benefits:
- Keyboard navigation built-in
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management
- ARIA attributes automatically applied
- Tested against accessibility standards

## Keyboard Navigation

### Focus Management

**Focus visible states:**
```tsx
<Button className="focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2">
  Accessible Button
</Button>
```

**Skip to content:**
```tsx
<a href="#main-content" className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:top-4 focus:left-4 focus:z-50 focus:px-4 focus:py-2">
  Skip to content
</a>

<main id="main-content">
  {/* Content */}
</main>
```

### Dialog/Modal Navigation

Dialogs trap focus automatically via Radix Dialog primitive:

```tsx
import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogTrigger } from "@/components/ui/dialog"

<Dialog>
  <DialogTrigger>Open</DialogTrigger>
  <DialogContent>
    {/* Focus trapped here */}
    <input />  {/* Auto-focused */}
    <Button>Action</Button>
    {/* Esc to close, Tab to navigate */}
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

Features:
- Focus trapped within dialog
- Esc key closes
- Tab cycles through focusable elements
- Focus returns to trigger on close

### Dropdown/Menu Navigation

```tsx
import { DropdownMenu, DropdownMenuContent, DropdownMenuItem, DropdownMenuTrigger } from "@/components/ui/dropdown-menu"

<DropdownMenu>
  <DropdownMenuTrigger>Open</DropdownMenuTrigger>
  <DropdownMenuContent>
    <DropdownMenuItem>Profile</DropdownMenuItem>
    <DropdownMenuItem>Settings</DropdownMenuItem>
    <DropdownMenuItem>Logout</DropdownMenuItem>
  </DropdownMenuContent>
</DropdownMenu>
```

Keyboard shortcuts:
- `Space/Enter`: Open menu
- `Arrow Up/Down`: Navigate items
- `Esc`: Close menu
- `Tab`: Close and move focus

### Command Palette Navigation

```tsx
import { Command } from "@/components/ui/command"

<Command>
  <CommandInput placeholder="Search..." />
  <CommandList>
    <CommandGroup heading="Suggestions">
      <CommandItem>Calendar</CommandItem>
      <CommandItem>Search</CommandItem>
    </CommandGroup>
  </CommandList>
</Command>
```

Features:
- Type to filter
- Arrow keys to navigate
- Enter to select
- Esc to close

## Screen Reader Support

### Semantic HTML

Use proper HTML elements:

```tsx
// Good: Semantic HTML
<button>Click me</button>
<nav><a href="/">Home</a></nav>

// Avoid: Div soup
<div onClick={handler}>Click me</div>
```

### ARIA Labels

**Label interactive elements:**
```tsx
<Button aria-label="Close dialog">
  <X className="h-4 w-4" />
</Button>

<Input aria-label="Email address" type="email" />
```

**Describe elements:**
```tsx
<Button aria-describedby="delete-description">
  Delete Account
</Button>
<p id="delete-description" className="sr-only">
  This action permanently deletes your account and cannot be undone
</p>
```

### Screen Reader Only Text

Use `sr-only` class for screen reader only content:

```tsx
<Button>
  <Trash className="h-4 w-4" />
  <span className="sr-only">Delete item</span>
</Button>

// CSS for sr-only
.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border-width: 0;
}
```

### Live Regions

Announce dynamic content:

```tsx
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
  {message}
</div>

// For urgent updates
<div aria-live="assertive">
  {error}
</div>
```

Toast component includes live region:
```tsx
const { toast } = useToast()

toast({
  title: "Success",
  description: "Profile updated"
})
// Announced to screen readers automatically
```

## Form Accessibility

### Labels and Descriptions

**Always label inputs:**
```tsx
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"

<div>
  <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
  <Input id="email" type="email" />
</div>
```

**Add descriptions:**
```tsx
import { FormDescription, FormMessage } from "@/components/ui/form"

<FormItem>
  <FormLabel>Username</FormLabel>
  <FormControl>
    <Input {...field} />
  </FormControl>
  <FormDescription>
    Your public display name
  </FormDescription>
  <FormMessage />  {/* Error messages */}
</FormItem>
```

### Error Handling

Announce errors to screen readers:

```tsx
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="email"
  render={({ field, fieldState }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Email</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input
          {...field}
          aria-invalid={!!fieldState.error}
          aria-describedby={fieldState.error ? "email-error" : undefined}
        />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage id="email-error" />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

### Required Fields

Indicate required fields:

```tsx
<Label htmlFor="name">
  Name <span className="text-destructive">*</span>
  <span className="sr-only">(required)</span>
</Label>
<Input id="name" required />
```

### Fieldset and Legend

Group related fields:

```tsx
<fieldset>
  <legend className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">
    Contact Information
  </legend>
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <FormField name="email" />
    <FormField name="phone" />
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

## Component-Specific Patterns

### Accordion

```tsx
import { Accordion } from "@/components/ui/accordion"

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      {/* Includes aria-expanded, aria-controls automatically */}
      Is it accessible?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      {/* Hidden when collapsed, announced when expanded */}
      Yes. Follows WAI-ARIA design pattern.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Tabs

```tsx
import { Tabs } from "@/components/ui/tabs"

<Tabs defaultValue="account">
  <TabsList role="tablist">
    {/* Arrow keys navigate, Space/Enter activates */}
    <TabsTrigger value="account">Account</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="password">Password</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="account">
    {/* Hidden unless selected, aria-labelledby links to trigger */}
    Account content
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

### Select

```tsx
import { Select } from "@/components/ui/select"

<Select>
  <SelectTrigger aria-label="Choose theme">
    <SelectValue placeholder="Theme" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    {/* Keyboard navigable, announced to screen readers */}
    <SelectItem value="light">Light</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="dark">Dark</SelectItem>
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
```

### Checkbox and Radio

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from "@/components/ui/checkbox"
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label"

<div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
  <Checkbox id="terms" aria-describedby="terms-description" />
  <Label htmlFor="terms">Accept terms</Label>
</div>
<p id="terms-description" className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  You agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
</p>
```

### Alert

```tsx
import { Alert } from "@/components/ui/alert"

<Alert role="alert">
  {/* Announced immediately to screen readers */}
  <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Your session has expired
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```

## Color Contrast

Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background.

**WCAG Requirements:**
- **AA**: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **AAA**: 7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text

**Check defaults:**
```tsx
// Good: High contrast
<p className="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Text</p>

// Avoid: Low contrast
<p className="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600">Hard to read</p>
```

**Muted text:**
```tsx
// Use semantic muted foreground
<p className="text-muted-foreground">
  Secondary text with accessible contrast
</p>
```

## Focus Indicators

Always provide visible focus indicators:

**Default focus ring:**
```tsx
<Button className="focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2">
  Button
</Button>
```

**Custom focus styles:**
```tsx
<a href="#" className="focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary focus-visible:underline">
  Link
</a>
```

**Don't remove focus styles:**
```tsx
// Avoid
<button className="focus:outline-none">Bad</button>

// Use focus-visible instead
<button className="focus-visible:ring-2">Good</button>
```

## Motion and Animation

Respect reduced motion preference:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

In components:
```tsx
<div className="transition-all motion-reduce:transition-none">
  Respects user preference
</div>
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Screen reader announces all content correctly
- [ ] Form errors announced and associated
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- [ ] Semantic HTML used
- [ ] ARIA labels provided for icon-only buttons
- [ ] Modal/dialog focus trap works
- [ ] Dropdown/select keyboard navigable
- [ ] Live regions announce updates
- [ ] Respects reduced motion preference
- [ ] Works with browser zoom up to 200%
- [ ] Tab order logical
- [ ] Skip links provided for navigation

## Tools

**Testing tools:**
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- axe DevTools browser extension
- NVDA/JAWS screen readers
- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- Color contrast checkers (Contrast Ratio, WebAIM)

**Automated testing:**
```bash
npm install -D @axe-core/react
```

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  import('@axe-core/react').then((axe) => {
    axe.default(React, ReactDOM, 1000)
  })
}
```

## `references/shadcn-theming.md`

# shadcn/ui Theming & Customization

Theme configuration, CSS variables, dark mode, and component customization.

## Dark Mode Setup

### Next.js App Router

**1. Install next-themes:**
```bash
npm install next-themes
```

**2. Create theme provider:**
```tsx
// components/theme-provider.tsx
"use client"

import * as React from "react"
import { ThemeProvider as NextThemesProvider } from "next-themes"

export function ThemeProvider({
  children,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof NextThemesProvider>) {
  return <NextThemesProvider {...props}>{children}</NextThemesProvider>
}
```

**3. Wrap app:**
```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider"

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider
          attribute="class"
          defaultTheme="system"
          enableSystem
          disableTransitionOnChange
        >
          {children}
        </ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

**4. Theme toggle component:**
```tsx
import { Moon, Sun } from "lucide-react"
import { useTheme } from "next-themes"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function ThemeToggle() {
  const { setTheme, theme } = useTheme()

  return (
    <Button
      variant="ghost"
      size="icon"
      onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}
    >
      <Sun className="h-[1.2rem] w-[1.2rem] rotate-0 scale-100 transition-all dark:-rotate-90 dark:scale-0" />
      <Moon className="absolute h-[1.2rem] w-[1.2rem] rotate-90 scale-0 transition-all dark:rotate-0 dark:scale-100" />
      <span className="sr-only">Toggle theme</span>
    </Button>
  )
}
```

### Vite / Other Frameworks

Use similar approach with next-themes or implement custom solution:

```javascript
// Store preference
function toggleDarkMode() {
  const isDark = document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark')
  localStorage.setItem('theme', isDark ? 'dark' : 'light')
}

// Initialize on load
if (localStorage.theme === 'dark' ||
    (!('theme' in localStorage) &&
     window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches)) {
  document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')
}
```

## CSS Variable System

shadcn/ui uses CSS variables for theming. Variables defined in `globals.css`:

```css
@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: 0 0% 100%;
    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;
    --secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --muted: 210 40% 96.1%;
    --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;
    --accent: 210 40% 96.1%;
    --accent-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;
    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
    --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
    --ring: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --radius: 0.5rem;
  }

  .dark {
    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --primary: 210 40% 98%;
    --primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --secondary: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.1%;
    --accent: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;
    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --ring: 212.7 26.8% 83.9%;
  }
}
```

### Color Format

Values use HSL format without `hsl()` wrapper for better opacity control:
```css
--primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;  /* H S L */
```

Usage in Tailwind:
```css
background: hsl(var(--primary));
background: hsl(var(--primary) / 0.5);  /* 50% opacity */
```

## Tailwind Configuration

Map CSS variables to Tailwind utilities:

```ts
// tailwind.config.ts
export default {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        border: "hsl(var(--border))",
        input: "hsl(var(--input))",
        ring: "hsl(var(--ring))",
        background: "hsl(var(--background))",
        foreground: "hsl(var(--foreground))",
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: "hsl(var(--primary))",
          foreground: "hsl(var(--primary-foreground))",
        },
        secondary: {
          DEFAULT: "hsl(var(--secondary))",
          foreground: "hsl(var(--secondary-foreground))",
        },
        destructive: {
          DEFAULT: "hsl(var(--destructive))",
          foreground: "hsl(var(--destructive-foreground))",
        },
        muted: {
          DEFAULT: "hsl(var(--muted))",
          foreground: "hsl(var(--muted-foreground))",
        },
        accent: {
          DEFAULT: "hsl(var(--accent))",
          foreground: "hsl(var(--accent-foreground))",
        },
      },
      borderRadius: {
        lg: "var(--radius)",
        md: "calc(var(--radius) - 2px)",
        sm: "calc(var(--radius) - 4px)",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Color Customization

### Method 1: Update CSS Variables

Change colors by modifying CSS variables in `globals.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 262.1 83.3% 57.8%;  /* Purple */
  --primary-foreground: 210 20% 98%;
}

.dark {
  --primary: 263.4 70% 50.4%;  /* Darker purple */
  --primary-foreground: 210 20% 98%;
}
```

### Method 2: Theme Generator

Use shadcn/ui theme generator: https://ui.shadcn.com/themes

Select base color, generate theme, copy CSS variables.

### Method 3: Multiple Themes

Create theme variants with data attributes:

```css
[data-theme="violet"] {
  --primary: 262.1 83.3% 57.8%;
  --primary-foreground: 210 20% 98%;
}

[data-theme="rose"] {
  --primary: 346.8 77.2% 49.8%;
  --primary-foreground: 355.7 100% 97.3%;
}
```

Apply theme:
```tsx
<div data-theme="violet">
  <Button>Violet theme</Button>
</div>
```

## Component Customization

Components live in your codebase - modify directly.

### Customize Variants

```tsx
// components/ui/button.tsx
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground",
        destructive: "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground",
        outline: "border border-input bg-background",
        // Add custom variant
        gradient: "bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 text-white",
      },
      size: {
        default: "h-10 px-4 py-2",
        sm: "h-9 rounded-md px-3",
        lg: "h-11 rounded-md px-8",
        // Add custom size
        xl: "h-14 rounded-md px-10 text-lg",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
)
```

Usage:
```tsx
<Button variant="gradient" size="xl">Custom Button</Button>
```

### Customize Styles

Modify base styles in component:

```tsx
// components/ui/card.tsx
const Card = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn(
      "rounded-xl border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-lg",  // Modified
      className
    )}
    {...props}
  />
))
```

### Override with className

Pass additional classes to override:

```tsx
<Card className="border-2 border-purple-500 shadow-2xl hover:scale-105 transition-transform">
  Custom styled card
</Card>
```

## Base Color Presets

shadcn/ui provides base color presets during `init`:

- **Slate**: Cool gray tones
- **Gray**: Neutral gray
- **Zinc**: Warm gray
- **Neutral**: Balanced gray
- **Stone**: Earthy gray

Select during setup or change later by updating CSS variables.

## Style Variants

Two component styles available:

- **Default**: Softer, more rounded
- **New York**: Sharp, more contrast

Select during `init` or in `components.json`:

```json
{
  "style": "new-york",
  "tailwind": {
    "cssVariables": true
  }
}
```

## Radius Customization

Control border radius globally:

```css
:root {
  --radius: 0.5rem;  /* Default */
  --radius: 0rem;    /* Sharp corners */
  --radius: 1rem;    /* Rounded */
}
```

Components use radius variable:
```tsx
className="rounded-lg"  /* Uses var(--radius) */
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use CSS Variables**: Enables runtime theme switching
2. **Consistent Foreground Colors**: Pair each color with appropriate foreground
3. **Test Both Themes**: Verify components in light and dark modes
4. **Semantic Naming**: Use `destructive` not `red`, `muted` not `gray`
5. **Accessibility**: Maintain sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
6. **Component Overrides**: Use `className` prop for one-off customization
7. **Extract Patterns**: Create custom variants for repeated customizations

## `references/tailwind-customization.md`

# Tailwind CSS Customization

Config file structure, custom utilities, plugins, and theme extensions.

## @theme Directive

Modern approach to customize Tailwind using CSS:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  /* Custom colors */
  --color-brand-50: oklch(0.97 0.02 264);
  --color-brand-500: oklch(0.55 0.22 264);
  --color-brand-900: oklch(0.25 0.15 264);

  /* Custom fonts */
  --font-display: "Satoshi", "Inter", sans-serif;
  --font-body: "Inter", system-ui, sans-serif;

  /* Custom spacing */
  --spacing-18: calc(var(--spacing) * 18);
  --spacing-navbar: 4.5rem;

  /* Custom breakpoints */
  --breakpoint-3xl: 120rem;
  --breakpoint-tablet: 48rem;

  /* Custom shadows */
  --shadow-glow: 0 0 20px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.3);

  /* Custom radius */
  --radius-large: 1.5rem;
}
```

**Usage:**
```html
<div class="bg-brand-500 font-display shadow-glow rounded-large">
  Custom themed element
</div>

<div class="tablet:grid-cols-2 3xl:grid-cols-6">
  Custom breakpoints
</div>
```

## Color Customization

### Custom Color Palette

```css
@theme {
  /* Full color scale */
  --color-primary-50: oklch(0.98 0.02 250);
  --color-primary-100: oklch(0.95 0.05 250);
  --color-primary-200: oklch(0.90 0.10 250);
  --color-primary-300: oklch(0.85 0.15 250);
  --color-primary-400: oklch(0.75 0.18 250);
  --color-primary-500: oklch(0.65 0.22 250);
  --color-primary-600: oklch(0.55 0.22 250);
  --color-primary-700: oklch(0.45 0.20 250);
  --color-primary-800: oklch(0.35 0.18 250);
  --color-primary-900: oklch(0.25 0.15 250);
  --color-primary-950: oklch(0.15 0.10 250);
}
```

### Semantic Colors

```css
@theme {
  --color-success: oklch(0.65 0.18 145);
  --color-warning: oklch(0.75 0.15 85);
  --color-error: oklch(0.60 0.22 25);
  --color-info: oklch(0.65 0.18 240);
}
```

```html
<div class="bg-success text-white">Success message</div>
<div class="border-error">Error state</div>
```

## Typography Customization

### Custom Fonts

```css
@theme {
  --font-sans: "Inter", system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-serif: "Merriweather", Georgia, serif;
  --font-mono: "JetBrains Mono", Consolas, monospace;
  --font-display: "Playfair Display", serif;
}
```

```html
<h1 class="font-display">Display heading</h1>
<p class="font-sans">Body text</p>
<code class="font-mono">Code block</code>
```

### Custom Font Sizes

```css
@theme {
  --font-size-xs: 0.75rem;
  --font-size-sm: 0.875rem;
  --font-size-base: 1rem;
  --font-size-lg: 1.125rem;
  --font-size-xl: 1.25rem;
  --font-size-2xl: 1.5rem;
  --font-size-3xl: 1.875rem;
  --font-size-4xl: 2.25rem;
  --font-size-5xl: 3rem;
  --font-size-jumbo: 4rem;
}
```

## Spacing Customization

```css
@theme {
  /* Add custom spacing values */
  --spacing-13: calc(var(--spacing) * 13);
  --spacing-15: calc(var(--spacing) * 15);
  --spacing-18: calc(var(--spacing) * 18);

  /* Named spacing */
  --spacing-header: 4rem;
  --spacing-footer: 3rem;
  --spacing-section: 6rem;
}
```

```html
<div class="p-18">Custom padding</div>
<section class="py-section">Section spacing</section>
```

## Custom Utilities

Create reusable utility classes:

```css
@utility content-auto {
  content-visibility: auto;
}

@utility tab-* {
  tab-size: var(--tab-size-*);
}

@utility glass {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}
```

**Usage:**
```html
<div class="content-auto">Optimized rendering</div>
<pre class="tab-4">Code with 4-space tabs</pre>
<div class="glass">Glassmorphism effect</div>
```

## Custom Variants

Create custom state variants:

```css
@custom-variant theme-midnight (&:where([data-theme="midnight"] *));
@custom-variant aria-checked (&[aria-checked="true"]);
@custom-variant required (&:required);
```

**Usage:**
```html
<div data-theme="midnight">
  <div class="theme-midnight:bg-navy-900">
    Applies in midnight theme
  </div>
</div>

<input class="required:border-red-500" required />
```

## Layer Organization

Organize CSS into layers:

```css
@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight;
  }

  h2 {
    @apply text-3xl font-semibold;
  }

  a {
    @apply text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline-offset-4 hover:underline;
  }

  body {
    @apply bg-background text-foreground antialiased;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .btn {
    @apply px-4 py-2 rounded-lg font-medium transition-colors;
  }

  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700;
  }

  .btn-secondary {
    @apply bg-gray-200 text-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-300;
  }

  .card {
    @apply bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-6 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow;
  }

  .input {
    @apply w-full px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-transparent;
  }
}

@layer utilities {
  .text-balance {
    text-wrap: balance;
  }

  .scrollbar-hide {
    -ms-overflow-style: none;
    scrollbar-width: none;
  }
  .scrollbar-hide::-webkit-scrollbar {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

## @apply Directive

Extract repeated utility patterns:

```css
.btn-primary {
  @apply bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 active:bg-blue-800 text-white font-semibold px-6 py-3 rounded-lg shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition-all duration-200 focus:outline-none focus:ring-4 focus:ring-blue-300;
}

.input-field {
  @apply w-full px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-transparent disabled:bg-gray-100 disabled:cursor-not-allowed;
}

.section-container {
  @apply container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 max-w-7xl;
}
```

**Usage:**
```html
<button class="btn-primary">Click me</button>
<input class="input-field" />
<div class="section-container">Content</div>
```

          boxShadow: theme('boxShadow.md'),
        },
      })
    }),
  ],
}
```

## Configuration Examples

### Complete Tailwind Config

```javascript
// tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

const config: Config = {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: "2rem",
      screens: {
        "2xl": "1400px",
      },
    },
    extend: {
      colors: {
        border: "hsl(var(--border))",
        input: "hsl(var(--input))",
        ring: "hsl(var(--ring))",
        background: "hsl(var(--background))",
        foreground: "hsl(var(--foreground))",
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: "hsl(var(--primary))",
          foreground: "hsl(var(--primary-foreground))",
        },
        brand: {
          50: '#f0f9ff',
          500: '#3b82f6',
          900: '#1e3a8a',
        },
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
        display: ['Playfair Display', 'serif'],
      },
      spacing: {
        '18': '4.5rem',
        '88': '22rem',
        '128': '32rem',
      },
      borderRadius: {
        lg: "var(--radius)",
        md: "calc(var(--radius) - 2px)",
        sm: "calc(var(--radius) - 4px)",
      },
      keyframes: {
        "slide-in": {
          "0%": { transform: "translateX(-100%)" },
          "100%": { transform: "translateX(0)" },
        },
      },
      animation: {
        "slide-in": "slide-in 0.5s ease-out",
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("tailwindcss-animate")],
}

export default config
```

## Dark Mode Configuration

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
export default {
  darkMode: ["class"],  // or "media" for automatic
  // ...
}
```

**Usage:**
```html
<!-- Class-based -->
<html class="dark">
  <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900">
    Responds to .dark class
  </div>
</html>

<!-- Media query-based -->
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900">
  Responds to system preference automatically
</div>
```

## Content Configuration

Specify files to scan for classes:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
export default {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  // ...
}
```

### Safelist

Preserve dynamic classes:

```javascript
export default {
  safelist: [
    'bg-red-500',
    'bg-green-500',
    'bg-blue-500',
    {
      pattern: /bg-(red|green|blue)-(100|500|900)/,
    },
  ],
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use @theme for simple customizations**: Prefer CSS-based customization
2. **Extract components sparingly**: Use @apply only for truly repeated patterns
3. **Leverage design tokens**: Define custom tokens in @theme
4. **Layer organization**: Keep base, components, and utilities separate
5. **Plugin for complex logic**: Use plugins for advanced customizations
6. **Test dark mode**: Ensure custom colors work in both themes
7. **Document custom utilities**: Add comments explaining custom classes
8. **Semantic naming**: Use descriptive names (primary not blue)

## `references/tailwind-responsive.md`

# Tailwind CSS Responsive Design

Mobile-first breakpoints, responsive utilities, and adaptive layouts.

## Mobile-First Approach

Tailwind uses mobile-first responsive design. Base styles apply to all screen sizes, then use breakpoint prefixes to override at larger sizes.

```html
<!-- Base: 1 column (mobile)
     sm: 2 columns (tablet)
     lg: 4 columns (desktop) -->
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>
```

## Breakpoint System

**Default breakpoints:**

| Prefix | Min Width | CSS Media Query |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| `sm:` | 640px | `@media (min-width: 640px)` |
| `md:` | 768px | `@media (min-width: 768px)` |
| `lg:` | 1024px | `@media (min-width: 1024px)` |
| `xl:` | 1280px | `@media (min-width: 1280px)` |
| `2xl:` | 1536px | `@media (min-width: 1536px)` |

## Responsive Patterns

### Layout Changes

```html
<!-- Vertical on mobile, horizontal on desktop -->
<div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-4">

  Centered with responsive max width
</div>
```

## Common Responsive Layouts

### Sidebar Layout

```html
<div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row min-h-screen">
  <!-- Sidebar: Full width on mobile, fixed on desktop -->
  <aside class="w-full lg:w-64 bg-gray-100 p-4">
    Sidebar
  </aside>

  <!-- Main content -->
  <main class="flex-1 p-4 md:p-8">
    Main content
  </main>
</div>
```

### Card Grid

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-4 md:gap-6">
  <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">Card 1</div>

  <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">Card 3</div>
  <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">Card 4</div>
</div>
```

### Hero Section

```html
<section class="py-12 md:py-20 lg:py-32">
  <div class="container mx-auto px-4">
    <div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row items-center gap-8 lg:gap-12">
      <div class="flex-1 text-center lg:text-left">
        <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold mb-4">
          Hero Title
        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-6">
          Hero description
        </p>
        <button class="px-6 py-3 md:px-8 md:py-4">
          CTA Button
        </button>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-1">
        <img src="hero.jpg" class="w-full rounded-lg" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Navigation

```html
<nav class="bg-white shadow">
  <div class="container mx-auto px-4">
    <div class="flex items-center justify-between h-16">
      <div class="text-xl font-bold">Logo</div>

      <!-- Desktop navigation -->
      <div class="hidden md:flex gap-6">
        <a href="#">Home</a>
        <a href="#">About</a>
        <a href="#">Services</a>
        <a href="#">Contact</a>
      </div>

      <!-- Mobile menu button -->
      <button class="md:hidden">
        <svg class="w-6 h-6">...</svg>
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</nav>
```

## Max-Width Queries

Apply styles only below certain breakpoint using `max-*:` prefix:

```html
<!-- Only on mobile and tablet (below 1024px) -->
<div class="max-lg:text-center">
  Centered on mobile/tablet, left-aligned on desktop
</div>

<!-- Only on mobile (below 640px) -->
<div class="max-sm:hidden">
  Hidden only on mobile
</div>
```

Available: `max-sm:` `max-md:` `max-lg:` `max-xl:` `max-2xl:`

## Range Queries

Apply styles between breakpoints:

```html
<!-- Only on tablets (between md and lg) -->
<div class="md:block lg:hidden">
  Visible only on tablets
</div>

<!-- Between sm and xl -->
<div class="sm:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-4">
  2 columns on tablet, 4 on extra large
</div>
```

## Container Queries

Style elements based on parent container width:

```html
<div class="@container">
  <div class="@md:grid-cols-2 @lg:grid-cols-3">
    Responds to parent width, not viewport
  </div>
</div>
```

Container query breakpoints: `@sm:` `@md:` `@lg:` `@xl:` `@2xl:`

## Custom Breakpoints

Define custom breakpoints in theme:

```css
@theme {
  --breakpoint-3xl: 120rem;  /* 1920px */
  --breakpoint-tablet: 48rem;  /* 768px */
}
```

```html
<div class="tablet:grid-cols-2 3xl:grid-cols-6">
  Uses custom breakpoints
</div>
```

## Responsive State Variants

Combine responsive with hover/focus:

```html
<!-- Hover effect only on desktop -->
<button class="lg:hover:scale-105">
  Scale on hover (desktop only)
</button>

<!-- Different hover colors per breakpoint -->
<a class="hover:text-blue-600 lg:hover:text-purple-600">
  Link
</a>
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Mobile-First Design

Start with mobile styles, add complexity at larger breakpoints:

```html
<!-- Good: Mobile first -->
<div class="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">

<!-- Avoid: Desktop first -->
<div class="text-xl lg:text-base">
```

### 2. Consistent Breakpoint Usage

Use same breakpoints across related elements:

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 md:gap-6 lg:gap-8">
  Spacing scales with layout
</div>
```

### 3. Test at Breakpoint Boundaries

Test at exact breakpoint widths (640px, 768px, 1024px, etc.) to catch edge cases.

### 4. Use Container for Content Width

```html
<div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
  <div class="max-w-7xl">
    Content with consistent max width
  </div>
</div>
```

### 5. Progressive Enhancement

Ensure core functionality works on mobile, enhance for larger screens:

```html
<!-- Core layout works on mobile -->
<div class="p-4">
  <!-- Enhanced spacing on desktop -->
  <div class="lg:p-8">
    Content
  </div>
</div>
```

### 6. Avoid Too Many Breakpoints

Use 2-3 breakpoints per element for maintainability:

```html
<!-- Good: 2 breakpoints -->
<div class="grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4">

<!-- Avoid: Too many breakpoints -->
<div class="grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5 2xl:grid-cols-6">
```

## Common Responsive Utilities

### Responsive Display

```html
<div class="block md:flex lg:grid">
  Changes display type per breakpoint
</div>
```

### Responsive Position

```html
<div class="relative lg:absolute">
  Positioned differently per breakpoint
</div>
```

### Responsive Order

```html
<div class="flex flex-col">
  <div class="order-2 lg:order-1">First on desktop</div>
  <div class="order-1 lg:order-2">First on mobile</div>
</div>
```

### Responsive Overflow

```html
<div class="overflow-auto lg:overflow-visible">
  Scrollable on mobile, expanded on desktop
</div>
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test at 320px (small mobile)
- [ ] Test at 640px (mobile breakpoint)
- [ ] Test at 768px (tablet breakpoint)
- [ ] Test at 1024px (desktop breakpoint)
- [ ] Test at 1280px (large desktop breakpoint)
- [ ] Test landscape orientation
- [ ] Verify touch targets (min 44x44px)
- [ ] Check text readability at all sizes
- [ ] Verify navigation works on mobile
- [ ] Test with browser zoom
